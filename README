# Reverse Shell Rootkit

## Overview
This project contains a reverse shell rootkit, designed for educational purposes, to demonstrate advanced techniques in Linux process and file manipulation. It establishes a reverse shell on a target ("victim") machine and conceals its processes and network connections from common monitoring tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Ensure Python is installed on the target machine. The script is compatible with both Python 2 (`python`) and Python 3 (`python3`).
- Verify the IP address of the attacker's machine is correctly configured in the script.
- Familiarize yourself with how your system displays processes with `ps aux` to make any necessary adjustments to the script.

### Setup
1. **Attacker's Machine:**
   - Run the Netcat listener:
     ```
     nc -lvnp 9001
     ```
   - This sets up a listening port to receive the reverse shell connection.

2. **Victim's Machine:**
   - Execute the rootkit script:
     ```
     python3 rvshell_rootkit.py
     ```
     or
     ```
     python rvshell_rootkit_v2.py
     ```
   - This initiates the reverse shell and hides its presence.

### Functionality
The rootkit:
- Opens a reverse shell to the attacker's machine.
- Hides relevant processes from `ps aux`.
- Conceals connections from `netstat -tunap` by manipulating `/proc/net/tcp` and redirecting `fopen64` to a crafted TCP file.

### Additional Scripts
- **Appending Libraries to System Files:**
  Use `attacks_ver1.py` to append created libraries to `/etc/bash.bashrc`. This hides processes system-wide:
    ```
     python3 attacks_ver1.py append
     ```
     or
     ```
     python attacks_ver1.py append
     ```

- **Cleanup:**
To revert changes, clean up the environment, and remove traces from system files:
    ```
     python3 attacks_ver1.py clean
     ```
     or
     ```
     python attacks_ver1.py clean
     ```

## Disclaimer
This program is intended **strictly for educational purposes**. It demonstrates techniques that manipulate system-level processes and files, which can have significant security and operational implications. Users are advised to operate it in a controlled environment and fully understand the risks involved. Improper use of this tool can lead to system instability or security vulnerabilities.
